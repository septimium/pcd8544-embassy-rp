//! This module exports the main PCD8544 struct and traits.
//! To use the driver, make a PCD8544.new() and call the methods on that.

//!  - PCD8544.set_contrast() to change the contrast of the display
//!  - PCD8544.set_light() to enable or disable the backlight.
//! The other functions are more "advanced" and only used in specific cases. You can change de
